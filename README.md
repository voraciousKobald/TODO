# TODO
## pmake:
project generation utility written in bash that is meant to set up an environment for EMACS.
+ compiler agnostic
+ language agnostic (probably too ambitious)
## SETUP:
Utility agnostic setup utility written in bash, it adds an alias for the utility if there isnt one already. I plan on making it more sophisticated later.
+ cobble up utility files based on what user wants, how i approach this is to be decided.
